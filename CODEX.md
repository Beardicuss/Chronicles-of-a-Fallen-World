## 🔮 The Five Visions

### I. First Vision — The Crimson Tide
*“And I saw a Pillar of Harmony falter, its light extinguished with a thunderous cry: 'The ichor of the corrupted shall flow like rivers from the breached veins of the world.'”*

When the three cosmic lights align in shadow, the Great Spire of Architect's Design shall crumble. From its consuming dust shall rise a nameless Fragment, bearing the mark of the Void's Hungering Will.

### II. Second Vision — The Twisted Truth
*“In the crimson ink of desecration, the great lie shall be etched: 'What was Balance shall be deemed folly, and the Path of Unmaking, salvation.'”*

When the chosen champion of Velquor's Heart rejects the solace of essence and embraces the blight-forged iron, the Path of Inverted Light shall begin. The key to the truth will be etched not in words, but in the echoes of memory.

### III. Third Vision — The Sundered Code
*“And its number shall be nine, yet lacking the tenth. Let he who comprehends the Sundered Code, tremble.”*

At the Hour of Unraveling, when the Mortal Coil rejects the Great Pattern and the Celestial Weave rejects the Prime Decree, the Reversion shall consume all. He who passes through the Nine Shatthresholds shall behold the Weaver's Grand Deception made manifest.

### IV. Fourth Vision — Birth of the Blighted Faith
*“From the heart of the world, a false prophet shall arise, veiled and sightless, yet perceiving all paths.”*

Her voice, a siren's call of false solace, her words, the bane of truth. She shall gather the blinded faithful to pry open the final gates to the Void's Devouring Maw.

### V. Secret Codicil — The Final Unveiling
*“The final conduit shall shatter by a fragmented soul's lament, a voice born of the Grey Between.”*

When the illusion of Balance becomes indistinguishable from the Blight's embrace, the Ancient Hunger shall descend. Its name is whispered in oblivion, for it is the Void made absolute.

## ☣️ The Blight & Corruption System

The core mechanic represents Dagon's struggle with his inherited power. Using **Blight Magic** increases **Corruption Saturation**.

### The Stacking Curse
Each time saturation reaches 100%, +1 **Curse Level** is gained. These effects are cumulative:

1.  **Fading Vitality**: Max HP reduced by 5-10%.
2.  **Siphon Weakness**: Max Blight Pool reduced by 5-10%.
3.  **Cracked Shell**: Defense/Armor Rating reduced by 5-10%.
4.  **Draining Fury**: Weapon Attack Damage reduced by 5-10%.
5.  **Echoing Madness**: Periodic chance to be staggered or interrupted.
6.  **Total Corruption**: All debuffs begin scaling further.

### Purification
Dagon must find **Altars of Equilibrium** and offer an **Echo of Equilibrium** (rare drops from powerful Blighted entities) to reset all Curse Levels.
